# Do you want to play a (guessing) game?

## How to play

Just open `index.html` in your browser and follow the prompts. Most questions will ask for a `yes` or `no` response. If you don't provide one, the game will tell you.

If you are guessing a number, make sure to enter an `Integer`; the game will let you know if you don't...

At the end of the game, you will be given feedback on your performance.

## Adding New questions
Add your question to the end of the `questions` array.
You must then create an array of acceptable answers and then push that array to the `answers` array.

You can modify the existing `yesAnswer` and `noAnswer` array or create your own.
