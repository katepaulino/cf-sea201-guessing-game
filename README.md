# Do you want to play a (guessing) game?

## How to play

Just open `index.html` in your browser and follow the prompts. Most questions will ask for a `yes` or `no` response. If you don't provide one, the game will tell you.

If you are guessing a number, make sure to enter an `Integer`; the game will let you know if you don't...

At the end of the game, you will be given feedback on your performance.
